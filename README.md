Cafe Management System Description
Overview
This is a simple Python-based cafe billing system that allows customers to place orders from a menu and generates an itemized bill with GST calculation.
How It Works
Menu Display
The system starts by displaying the "BCA CAFE" menu with items and prices:

Dosa: ₹120
Tea: ₹15
Coffee: ₹20
Idli: ₹50
Vada: ₹40

Order Process

Item Selection: Customer enters item names from the menu
Quantity Input: System asks for quantity of each item
Validation: Checks if entered item exists in menu
Error Handling: Prompts for correct item if invalid entry
Order Completion: Customer types "DONE" to finish ordering

Bill Generation
The system calculates and displays:

Item Details: Each ordered item with quantity and cost
Subtotal: Total bill before tax
Final Amount: Bill with 18% GST added

Key Features

Menu Dictionary: Stores item names and prices
Bill Tracking: Maintains order details and running total
Input Validation: Ensures only valid menu items are accepted
GST Calculation: Automatically adds 18% tax to final bill
Formatted Output: Clean, tabular display of bill details
